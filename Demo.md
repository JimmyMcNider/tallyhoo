I love the PRD here, but my team needs a very simple demo using React Vite, Supabase, Vercel, and Render (if necessary) in the next 30 minutes. Can you just build an MVP using what we care about most below?

User events in sequence:
    1. Instructor logs in, uploads their student list for the class, 
    2. then comes back to upload audio recording after every class, AI processes the class discussion on upload, evaluates each students’ performance in class, connects student voices to student identity on the platform, flags students with no credit or odd behavior for professor to approve, and professor finally submits evaluations for students as finalized.
    3. An instructor can come back to the platform and initiate an AI feedback report and creates a report by student, instructor approves the reports, and then emails each student their individual report.
